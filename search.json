For example, the below creates a variable called my_height and stores the in 140 there.\nmy_height = 140\nThe Python interpreter is now storing the int 140 in a bin called my_height. If you pass the variable name to the interpreter then it will behave just like if you typed in 140 instead.\nmy_height\n\n140\n140\nVariables are neat when it comes to lists.\nmy_heights = [231, 234, 43]\nmy_heights\n\n[231, 234, 43]\nmy_heights[1]\n\n234\nWait, what happened above? What do you think the [1] does?\nYou can index multiple values from a list.\nmy_heights[0:2]\n\n[231, 234]\nYou’ve reached the end of the first notebook. We’ve looked at basic data type and variables. These are key components of all programming languages and a key part of working with data.\nIn the next notebook we will examine using libraries, loading in data, loops and functions."

    "text": "2.1 Python?\nPython is a very popular general purpose programming language. Data scientists use it to clean up, analyse and visualise data. A major strength of python is that the core Python functionality can be extended using libraries. In future labs, you will learn about popular data science libraries such as pandas and numpy.\nIt is useful to think of programming languages as a structured way to tell the computer what to do. We cover some of the basic features of Python in this lab.\n\n2.1.1 Anaconda\nAnaconda is a collection of different programs. These programs include Python, many of the most popular data science libaries, Jupyter notebooks and development environments such as VS Code or Spyder, which are Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that we can use for python.\n\n\n2.1.2 Jupter Notebooks\nJupyter notebooks, such as this one, allow you to combine text and code into documents you can edit in the browser. The power of these notebooks is in documenting or describing what you are doing with the code alongside that code. For example, you could detail why you chose a particular clustering algorithm above the clustering code itself. In other words, it add narrative and helps clarify your workflow."
